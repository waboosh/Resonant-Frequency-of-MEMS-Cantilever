# Resonant-Frequency-of-MEMS-Cantilever 

<<<Application of this to something in the real world>>>

Nuclear radiation detectors are often bulky, expensive, and impractical. MEMS (Microelectromechanical) technology offers an alternative, tiny-scale versions with cheaper costs and high reliability. 
A microcantilever with a coating of polystyrene (PS) changes mass when exposed to nuclear radiation, and this mass change affects the resonant frequency.
-> This can act as a sensor that relates radiation dose to the resonant frequency. 

<<What the code does>>
Based on the geometry of the cantilever, we can model its resonant frequency due to a sample of radiation dose.
