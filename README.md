# Resonant-Frequency-of-MEMS-Cantilever 

Application:

Nuclear radiation detectors are often bulky, expensive, and impractical. MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems) technology offers an alternative, tiny-scale version with lower costs and high reliability. 
A microcantilever with a coating of polystyrene (PS) changes mass when exposed to nuclear radiation, and this mass change affects the resonant frequency.
-> This can act as a sensor that relates radiation dose to the resonant frequency. 

What Code Does:
Based on the geometry of the cantilever, we can model its resonant frequency due to a sample of radiation dose.

Two Ways to do the same thing:
1.  Uniformly distributed film
2.  Film determined just at the tip of the cantilever


Uniformly distributed better because of higher sensitivity.
